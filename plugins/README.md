# Ollama Code CLI Plugins

This directory contains plugins that extend Ollama Code CLI with custom commands, agents, and workflows. They demonstrate what's possible with the plugin system.

## What are Ollama Code CLI Plugins?

Plugins extend Ollama Code CLI with custom slash commands, specialized agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugins can be shared across projects and teams for consistent tooling and workflows.

## Installation

These plugins are included in the Ollama Code CLI repository. To use them:

1. Ensure **Ollama** is installed and running locally.
2. Install and run Ollama Code CLI from this repo:
   ```bash
   npm install && npm run build
   npx ollama-code
   ```
   Or run: `ollama-code` if installed/linked globally.
3. Use the `/plugin` command to install or configure plugins. Plugin settings go in `.ollama-code/settings.json` (we do not use `.claude/`, so Claude Code and Ollama Code CLI configs stay separate).

## Plugin Structure

Each plugin follows the standard plugin structure:

```
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/

```

## Contributing

When adding new plugins to this directory:

1. Follow the standard plugin structure
2. Include a comprehensive README.md
3. Add plugin metadata in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
